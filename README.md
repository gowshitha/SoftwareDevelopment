#WriteRight AI – AI-powered writing assistant that helps you “write right.” 
AI-powered writing assistant for grammar correction, paraphrasing, and summarization—helping you write smarter, clearer, and faster.


The proposed project is to develop a writing tool that incorporates the functionalities of both Grammarly and QuillBot. The new tool will be designed to help writers, students, and professionals to improve the quality of their written content. The tool will use AI and machine learning algorithms to identify and correct grammatical errors, sentence structure, and enhance the overall readability of the text.


SUMMARIZER:
Our summarizer solution is an AI-based writing tool with a feature that can condense long passages of text into shorter summaries. The summarizer analyzes the input text using natural language processing algorithms to extract the most pertinent sentences, phrases, and keywords. Then it creates a summary that condenses the original text's main ideas while keeping it concise.
Users can upload a document or enter their text directly into our summarizer to use it. So, the document or text the users are giving must have to be at least three words. Then, they can select from a variety of summarization options, ranging from a quick summary to a comprehensive rewrite of the text. After applying its algorithms, the tool creates a summary that users can then edit and refine.
Our summarizer uses cutting-edge machine learning methods and language models to effectively extract the key ideas from the input text. To produce a concise and cogent summary, the tool combines sentence compression, paraphrasing, and synonym replacement. Additionally, it offers users the chance to customize the summary's length and tenor to suit their needs.
All things considered, our summarizer feature is a strong tool that can assist users in quickly and effectively producing high-quality summaries from substantial amounts of text.


PARAPHRASING:
Our solution for Paraphrasing is an AI-based writing tool offers a paraphrasing feature to assist users in rewriting their text while maintaining the original meaning. The key phrases and concepts are found by analyzing the input text in the paraphraser. The program then creates a revised version of the text using different words and sentence structures while preserving the original meaning.
Users can directly enter their text into the tool or upload a document to use OUR's paraphrasing feature. To control how much the tool modifies the original text, they can then choose the paraphraser and modify the settings. Depending on their needs, users can select from a variety of options, including fluency, creativity, and simplicity.One tactic it employs is synonym replacement, in which specific words are exchanged for synonyms to convey the same meaning. Sentence shuffling is another tactic, where sentences are rearranged to create a new sentence structure while keeping the same meaning. Additionally, our solution uses sentence fusion, which combines two or more sentences into a single, shorter sentence.
Overall, our feature for paraphrasing is a strong one that can assist users in quickly and effectively rewriting their text. It can produce a rewritten version of the text that is both grammatically correct and maintains the original meaning while using different words and sentence structures by utilizing cutting-edge natural language processing techniques and an AI-based grammar checker.


SPELLING ERROR CHECKER:
Text Edit uses machine learning and natural language processing to identify and fix spelling mistakes in written content. The Text Edit algorithm checks the sentence or word you are typing against a sizable database of correctly spelled words as you type. It uses language tool python library in python, with that library we have  implemented our code.
Additionally, our Text Edit algorithm considers contextual elements like the word's part of speech, the sentence structure, and the sentence's intended meaning, allowing it to detect and correct spelling errors even in complex sentences.
